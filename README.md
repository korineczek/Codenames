## About

## How to set it up:
This game requires two computers to play. One of the computers is reserved for the teams' spymasters and the other one for the spies.
In terms of the network, the computer that is the host will be the spies, while the client is the spymasters.

#### Connecting over AAU-1x
Due to the funny way of how AAU's network is set up, we can't directly connect through direct IP connection to another machine as it will not be visible to us. However, there is a simple workaround to this issue.

You will need either a PC or a smartphone capable of creating its own WiFi network - on phones mostly known as WiFi tethering. Once you set up your own hotspot and connect the two machines to it, they will basically be together on a small local area network which allows us to connect directly.

The host presses "host game" on the networking panel in game. The client than copies the host's IP address, which the host can tell him by looking at his IP address located at the bottom right corner, puts it in the field next to "LAN Client" and presses the button. Once the client is connected, the host can press "Start game" and the game starts. Once the round is finished, press exit game to close the application.

If you want to start a new match, just reopen the app.
